# Ozone Simulation
For the final project for my Intro CS class at Harvey Mudd College, I used vPython to simulate the destruction of Ozone in the atmosphere.
Initially, Chloroflorocarbons (CFCs), which were formerly used as refrigirants, rise into the atmosphere. A CFC molecule may attach to a cloud, where it will break up and emit dichlorine. If the dichlorine is struck by an ultraviolet ray from the sun
